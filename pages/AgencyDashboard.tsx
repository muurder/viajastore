// The content of this file (pages/AgencyDashboard.tsx) was found to be a duplicate of the AdminDashboard component.
// To resolve this duplication and align component naming with file responsibilities,
// the AdminDashboard component and its logic have been removed from this file.
// The canonical AdminDashboard implementation is located in 'pages/AdminDashboard.tsx'.
// If an agency-specific dashboard component is intended for this file, it should be implemented here.

// This file is now empty, serving as a placeholder or to be filled with specific Agency Dashboard logic.
// If this file is meant to contain the Agency Dashboard, please rename 'AdminDashboard' to 'AgencyDashboard'
// and adjust its implementation to be agency-specific.
// Otherwise, if this file is not needed, it can be safely removed.
